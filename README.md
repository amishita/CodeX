## About
CodeX is an AI-guided learning platform designed to make Data Structures and Algorithms more intuitive and less intimidating.

Traditional coding platforms focus on whether a solution passes or fails. CodeX focuses on understanding. It analyzes a learner’s code, visualizes its execution step by step, and provides guided explanations that help improve logic and efficiency over time.

The goal of CodeX is to turn DSA practice into a continuous learning loop—where every attempt leads to clearer reasoning, better solutions, and stronger problem-solving skills.
